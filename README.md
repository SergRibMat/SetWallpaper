# SetWallpaper

This is an isolated test i did for an application i am developing and i found some interesting concepts to explain, 
so this little app will act as a visual help for the explanation.

Concepts i want to explain: 

- Show default data in ImageViews
- Do not block the UI thread because of code execution
- Show to the user if something is being loaded or someting went wrong

Libraries i used

- Glide
- Coroutines 

What does the app do? 

It is a single Activity application that takes the path of an image from your device, prints it on a View
and then, you have the option to make that image your device's wallpaper.
